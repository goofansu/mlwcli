# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Run

```bash
go build -o cli cmd/cli/main.go   # Build the binary
go run cmd/cli/main.go            # Run without building
go install github.com/goofansu/cli/cmd/cli@latest  # Install globally
```

## Architecture

This is a Go CLI tool for managing links (Linkding) and RSS feeds (Miniflux). It uses `go-flags` for command parsing with a nested subcommand structure.

### Package Structure

- **cmd/cli/main.go** - Entry point and command definitions. All CLI commands are defined as structs with `Execute()` methods. Commands embed `BaseCommand` for shared app access and `JSONOutputOptions` for output filtering.
- **internal/app/** - Business logic layer. `App` struct holds config and provides methods like `AddBookmark()`, `AddFeed()`, `ListEntries()`, `ListBookmarks()`.
- **internal/auth/** - Authentication flow. `Login()` validates credentials against the service before saving. `Logout()` removes service config.
- **internal/config/** - TOML config management at `~/.config/cli/config.toml`. Stores endpoint/API key per service.
- **internal/linkding/** - Linkding API client wrapper using `github.com/piero-vic/go-linkding`.
- **internal/miniflux/** - Miniflux API client wrapper using `miniflux.app/v2/client`.
- **internal/format/** - Output formatting with `--json` field filtering and `--jq` expression support via `gojq`.

### Command Flow

1. `main.go` loads config, creates `App`, wires it to command structs
2. `go-flags` parser routes to appropriate `Execute()` method
3. Command calls app layer method with options struct
4. App layer calls service client, formats output

### Output Format

List commands return `{total, items}` structure. Use `--json "field1,field2"` to filter fields or `--jq` for complex queries.
